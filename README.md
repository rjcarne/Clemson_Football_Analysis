# Clemson_Football_Analysis
 Dabo Era Football Production Breakdown

My end goal for this project is to create a new ranking system in college football. My idea is to create statistical models to predict outcomes of simulated games. I would use thousands of simulations against each team to determine which programs in college football should theoretically be ranked number 1-25.

The first challenge is the team by team data analytics. I decided to start by using my Alma Mater and current university as a starting point. 

I took all of the box scores from every game that Dabo Swinney has been the head coach at Clemson University and stored the data into multiple MS Excel files. I imported the data into RStudio in order to find statistical outliers, production based on recruiting ranking and any other statistic I could think of.

I am attempting to learn Data Science techniques so I tried to go with the most detailed data source I could find. I searched the ESPN game summaries for the box score of every game so that I could analyze progression throughout a season as well as total amounts over a player's career.

Also, I wanted to see how some of Clemson's tendencies changed over time as recruiting has improved and they have played in more high profile games.
