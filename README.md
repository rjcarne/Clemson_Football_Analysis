# Clemson_Football_Analysis
 Dabo Era Football Production Breakdown

My end goal for this project is to create a new ranking system in college football. My idea is to create statistical models to predict outcomes of simulated games. I would use thousands of simulations against each team to determine which programs in college football should theoretically be ranked number 1-25.

The first challenge is the team by team data analytics. I decided to start by using my Alma Mater and current university as a starting point. 

I took all of the box scores from every game that Dabo Swinney has been the head coach at Clemson University and stored the data into multiple MS Excel files. I then imported the data into RStudio and created regression models for each position that would attempt to predict the career production of a player based on a few variables. The main indicator of ability in football is the 247 composite ranking which high school football players are given coming into college. The best players are usually highly rated and my model reflects that.

I am attempting to learn Data Science techniques so I tried to go with the most detailed data source I could find. I took the box scores off of a website and combined all of them into an excel workbook for each season. Each workbook included a depth chart with the player's information and one worksheet for every game played that year. 

I wanted to see how some of Clemson's tendencies changed over time as recruiting has improved and they have played in more high profile games, but mainly, I set out to apply some data science ability and learn while using a data set that I understood and enjoyed working with. My plan is to continue adding data to the program as new games are available and add functionality to make it a more complete statistical analysis
